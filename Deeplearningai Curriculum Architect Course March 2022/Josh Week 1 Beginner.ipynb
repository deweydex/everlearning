What does it looks like visually? How might understanding matrix multiplication lead us to ask questions and create things like bases, eigenvalues and eigenvectors? In particular, together we will discover a way of visualizing the composition of basic composing matrix operations in 2 dimensions: starting with a description and ending up with a matrix that does the given operations. Finally we will visually shows what these operations look like in space so we can accurately describe and intuit what such a linear transformation can be seen as \"doing\" to a space. The goal is to show how this seemingly arbitrary multiplication algorithm gives us tools for changing space itself, with applications in fields ranging from computer graphics, visual art, quantum computing, basicially all statistics and most of physics... really this is one of those times where the applications are truly endless. \n","\n","### Target Learner:\n","The target learner for this tutorial wants to be able to visualize what impact linear operations (like matrix multiplication) have on a low dimensional spaces. How a matrix distorts even two dimensional space (in terms of reflection, rotation, and scaling) can be anything but intuitive. This course is for someone who wants to be able to make these abstract operations tangible: starting in low dimensions gives the learner a feel for how to apply thier gained insight to higher dimensions (where most of the fun problems and data can be encountered). This would be particuarly useful for someone with basic programming knowledge who has either taken thier first steps into linear algebra or is more experienced and looking for a way to step away from the symbols and make things be more tactile. \n","\n","### Assumptions: \n","I assume you is comfortable with:\n","- Python control flow (variable declarations, if, loops, function definition) - Python basic data structures (multidimensional lists/arrays)\n","- Numpy arrays and thier addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication\n","- Very basic plotting with matplotlib (for tutorials have a look here **LINK TODO**)\n","- The very basics of linear algebra (what a vector is, what a matrix is, how to add, multiply, invert, transpose...).\n","\n","NOTE: Highschool students can certainly grasp this material, but it can be helpful to already have had some exposure to both the numerical operations involved in matrix operations and function composition, for which khanacademy, 3blue1brown, Brilliant.org are highly recommended sources for problems and tutorials.\n","Personally I only learned such matrix magic later in my mathematical education, though I wish I had been shown it earlier.\n","\n","\n","### Learning Objective:\n","By the end of this course you will implement a method that creates a matrix that scales, rotates, and reflects a set of points in 2D as well as a tool for visualizing these actions (you might even tackle a the 3D case if you are feeling adventurous).\n","\n","Sylabus:\n","- Introduction: Implementing Matrix Multiplication\n","  * Video: Introduction Recap Matrix Multiplication on a 2x2 matrix 1 min\n","  * Coding Exercise: Implement matrix multiplication using the naive (two loop) algorithm\n","- Reflecting and Scaling:\n","  * Video: Reflecting Scaling with 2x2 matrices 2 min\n","  * Coding Exercise: Implementing Reflection and Scaling as Matrices\n","  * Quiz: 3 Visualizing the multiplication of a matrix to a vector, before and after style questions\n","- Rotation:\n","  * Text: Deriving Rotation with Matrices (with visuals for intuition)\n","  * Coding Exercise: Implementing Rotation through matrix multiplication with examples\n","  * Quiz: Connecting Common Angles of Rotation to Matrices\n","  * Coding Exercise: Generating Random Rotations\n","  * Coding Exercise: Reversing Rotations\n","- Composing a Matrix from scaling, rotation, and reflection operations:\n","  * Video: Introduction to composing a Matrix from given operations 2 mins \n","  * Text: Examples of creating a Matrix from given operations\n","  * Coding Exercise: Visualizing our Matrix Operations (Before and After Plots)\n","  * Coding Exercise: Applying our visualizations to a series of points\n","  * Quiz: Multiple solutions for the same operations?
