By the end of this course you will have created a tool that can scale, reflect, and rotate an image to get a feel for how various matrices distort 2D space by distoring images and sets of points. With an understanding of how these operations work in 2D you will be primed for applying similar operations to other images, or even apply them to higher dimensional problems (as a lot of the fun stuff is higher dimensional). This would be particuarly useful for someone with basic programming knowledge who has either taken thier first steps into linear algebra or is more experienced and looking for a way to step away from the symbols and make things be more visual and tangible. \n","\n","### Assumptions: \n","I assume you is comfortable with:\n","- Python control flow (variable declarations, if, loops, function definition) - Python basic data structures (multidimensional lists/arrays)\n","- Numpy arrays and thier addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication\n","- Very basic plotting with matplotlib (for tutorials have a look [here]())\n","- The very basics of linear algebra ([what a vector is](khan academy link), [what a matrix is](3blue1brownlink), [how to add, multiply, invert, transpose matrices][brilliant link).\n","\n","NOTE: Highschool students can certainly grasp this material, but it can be helpful to already have had some exposure to both the numerical operations involved in matrix operations and function composition, for more see the (re)sources of inspiration below. \n","\n","###General (Re)Sources of Inspiration:\n","[3Blue1Brown on Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=3&t=1s)\n","\n","[Brilliant on Linear Algebra](https://brilliant.org/courses/lin-alg/)\n","\n","[Khan Academy on Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)\n","\n","\n","### Learning Objective:\n","By the end of this course you will be able to reflect, scale, and rotate (SR&R) an image using matrix multiplication. You will also create a function that creates a matrix that carries out whatever combination of SR&R you specify. This will give you insight into how linear algebra can be applied in fields like computer graphics, digital image processing, and more broadly as these methods apply to a plethora of fields and higher dimensional contexts. As a bonus, this course will enable you to \"invent\" eigenvalues and eigenvectors in this applied visual setting.\n","\n","Sylabus:\n","- Introduction:\n","  * Video Manipulating Images with Linear Algebra\n","  * Prewritten code: Loading and viewing an image with a border\n","- Implementing Matrix Multiplication\n","  * Video: Introduction Recap Matrix Multiplication on a 2x2 matrix 1 min\n","  * Coding Exercise: Implement matrix multiplication using the naive (two loop) algorithm\n","- Reflecting and Scaling:\n","  * Video: Reflecting Scaling with 2x2 matrices 2 min\n","  * Coding Exercise: \n","    * Create a Reflection function using Matrix Multiplication\n","    * Create a Scale Function using Matrix Multiplication\n","    * Apply your Reflection and Scale functions to an image\n","    * View and reflect on the results\n","  * Quiz: 3 Match matrices to image transformations\n","- Rotation:\n","  * Text with Visuals: Deriving Rotation with Matrices\n","  * Coding Exercise: \n","    * Create a Degrees to Radians Function\n","    * Create a Rotation Function using Matrix Multiplication\n","    * Apply your rotation function to a set of points and an image\n","    * View and reflect on the results\n","  * Quiz: Convert Common Angles of Rotation to thier corresponding Matrices\n","  * Coding Exercise: \n","    * Create a function that generates a random rotation\n","    * Create a function that reverses a rotation\n","    * Apply your random rotation and rotation reversal functions to an image\n","    * View and reflect on the results\n","- Create a Matrix from scaling, rotation, and reflection operations:\n","  * Video: From Scaling, Reflection, and Rotation (SR&R) to a suitable Matrix\n","  * Text: Examples of Matrices generated using composition of SR&R\n","  * Coding Exercise: \n","    * Combine your SR&R Operations into a Generate Matrix function\n","    * Apply your generated matrix to a series of points\n","    * Apply your generated matrix to images\n","    * View and reflect on the results\n","    * Bonus: Create an inverse operation and visualize it\n","  * Quiz: Identify which matrices correspond to the same transformation\n","  * Quiz: Identify which matrix is not a composition of SR&R\n","- Conclusion and Future Ideaes and Adventures\n","  * Video: Summary and Future Exploration 2 Min\n","  * Bonus: Discover Eigenvectors and eigenvalues\n","    * Text: Find which vectors of an image only scale\n","    * Text: Find the scaling factor of those vectors\n","    * Coding Exercise: Create an Eigenvector Function\n","    * Coding Exercise: Create an Eigenvalue Function\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"759jvZdD14Zx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"gshTX9KUGCMs"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
