By the end of this course you will have created a tool that can scale, reflect, and rotate a vector graphic outline to get a feel for how various matrices distort 2D space by distoring outlines and sets of points. With an understanding of how these operations work in 2D you will be primed for applying similar operations to other vector graphics, or even apply them to higher dimensional problems like meshes in space (a lot of the fun stuff is higher dimensional). This would be particuarly useful for someone with basic programming knowledge who has either taken thier first steps into linear algebra or is more experienced and looking for a way to step away from the symbols and make things be more visual and tangible. \n","\n","### Assumptions: \n","I assume you is comfortable with:\n","- Python control flow (variable declarations, if, loops, function definition) - Python basic data structures (multidimensional lists/arrays)\n","- Numpy arrays and thier addition, multiplication, and scalar multiplication\n","- Very basic plotting with matplotlib (for tutorials have a look [here]())\n","- The very basics of linear algebra ([what a vector is](khan academy link), [what a matrix is](3blue1brownlink), [how to add, multiply, invert, transpose matrices][brilliant link).\n","\n","NOTE: Highschool students can certainly grasp this material, but it can be helpful to already have had some exposure to both the numerical operations involved in matrix operations and function composition, for more see the (re)sources of inspiration below. \n","\n","###General (Re)Sources of Inspiration:\n","[3Blue1Brown on Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=3&t=1s)\n","\n","[Brilliant on Linear Algebra](https://brilliant.org/courses/lin-alg/)\n","\n","[Khan Academy on Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)\n","\n","\n","### Learning Objective:\n","By the end of this course you will be able to reflect, scale, and rotate (SR&R) a vector outline using matrix multiplication. You will also create a function that creates a matrix that carries out whatever combination of SR&R you specify. This will give you insight into how linear algebra can be applied in fields like computer graphics, digital image processing, and more broadly as these methods apply to a plethora of fields and higher dimensional contexts. As a bonus, this course will enable you to \"invent\" eigenvalues and eigenvectors in this applied visual setting.\n","\n","Sylabus:\n","- Introduction:\n","  * Video Manipulating Images with Linear
