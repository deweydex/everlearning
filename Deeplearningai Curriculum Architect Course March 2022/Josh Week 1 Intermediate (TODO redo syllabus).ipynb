But visualizing what is under the hood is important here, especially since sphering can be a powerful tool when used in conjunction with various kernal tricks. In high dimensional data it can be easy to just abstract spehering away. Here we will try to make things as concrete as possible by visualizing sphering using 2 and 3D projections of high dimensional data. \n","\n","### Target Learner:\n","The Target Learner for this tutorial wants to be able to use sphering/whitening tools without treating them as a black box. In particular the target learner wants to use basic PCA based sphering to prepare data for further processing. Since they often deal with high dimensional data, they want to be able to see how sphering changes thier data using projections onto 2 or 3 dimensions.  \n","\n","### Assumptions:\n","We assume the learner is proficient in linear algebra and statistics as well as python, basic numpy, and visualization libraries like Matplotlib. It is assumed that they understand what a given library is (generally) doing when the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix are retrieved.\n","\n","### Learning Objectives:\n","By the end of this course the learner will create a basic sphering function as well as a visualizer for the results of that function by selecting 2 or 3 dimensions or a high dimensional dataset.\n","\n","\n","### Syllabus:\n","\n","TODO FIND BETTER SAMPLE DATASET!\n","TODO generate high dim gaussian data\n","TODO built-in 3d visualizer picker using matplotlib\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Uf0Pazc2SSXu"}}]}
