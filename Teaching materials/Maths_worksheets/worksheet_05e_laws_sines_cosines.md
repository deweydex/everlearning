## Part A: The Law of Sines (22 problems)

### The Formula

For ANY triangle with sides $a$, $b$, $c$ opposite angles $A$, $B$, $C$:

$$\boxed{\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}}$$

Equivalently: $\frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b} = \frac{\sin C}{c}$

**When to use:** When you know an angle and its opposite side, plus one other piece.

---

**Find the missing parts (round to 1 decimal place):**

**1.** Triangle with $A = 40°$, $B = 60°$, $a = 10$ cm. Find $b$ and $c$.

*Hint: First find $C = 180° - A - B$*

**2.** Triangle with $A = 35°$, $C = 75°$, $c = 15$ m. Find $a$ and $b$.

**3.** Triangle with $B = 52°$, $C = 48°$, $b = 8$ cm. Find $a$ and $c$.

**4.** Triangle with $A = 100°$, $B = 35°$, $a = 20$ m. Find $b$ and $c$.

---

### The Ambiguous Case (SSA)

When given two sides and an angle NOT between them (SSA), there may be:
- **No solution** (triangle impossible)
- **One solution** (unique triangle)
- **Two solutions** (two different triangles work!)

This happens because $\sin\theta = \sin(180° - \theta)$.

---

**5.** Triangle with $A = 30°$, $a = 5$, $b = 8$. 

Find angle $B$:
$\frac{\sin B}{8} = \frac{\sin 30°}{5}$

$\sin B = \frac{8 \cdot 0.5}{5} = 0.8$

$B = \sin^{-1}(0.8) = ?$ or $B = 180° - ?$

Are both solutions valid? (Check if $A + B < 180°$)

**6.** Triangle with $A = 40°$, $a = 12$, $b = 18$. How many solutions?

**7.** Triangle with $A = 60°$, $a = 10$, $b = 8$. How many solutions?

**8.** Triangle with $A = 45°$, $a = 6$, $b = 10$. How many solutions?

**🔭 Astronomy: Stellar Triangulation**

**9.** The parallax method for measuring star distances creates a triangle with:
- Earth at two positions 6 months apart (baseline = 2 AU ≈ 300 million km)
- The star at the third vertex
- The parallax angle $p$ at the star

For Sirius, if the angle at one Earth position is 89.999623° and at the other is 89.999631°:
- (a) What is the angle at Sirius (the parallax angle)?
- (b) Using Law of Sines with baseline 300 million km, estimate the distance to Sirius.

*Note: Actual parallax measurements are much more precise than this simplified example!*

**10.** Alpha Centauri has a parallax of about 0.76 arcseconds (convert to degrees: 1° = 3600 arcseconds).

Set up the Law of Sines equation to find its distance from the Sun.

---

**🔬 Microscopy: Electron Beam Triangulation**

**11.** In some electron microscope techniques, the beam hits a sample at an angle and the scattered electrons are detected.

If the beam hits at 15° from vertical, travels to the sample, and electrons scatter to a detector at 25° from vertical (on the opposite side), with the sample-to-detector distance being 50 mm:

Set up a triangle and use Law of Sines to find the beam path length from source to sample.

---

**🏗️ Surveying: Triangulation**

**12.** Surveyors measure the distance between two points A and B as 500 m. From A, the angle to a distant point C is 72°. From B, the angle to C is 63°.

- (a) What is angle C in the triangle ABC?
- (b) Find the distances AC and BC.

**13.** From two observation points 2 km apart, a mountain peak is sighted. The angles of elevation aren't needed — just the horizontal angles: from point A, the bearing to the peak is N 35° E, and from point B (due east of A), the bearing is N 52° W.

- (a) Sketch the triangle and find all three angles.
- (b) How far is the peak from point A?

---

## Part B: The Law of Cosines (22 problems)

### The Formula

For ANY triangle with sides $a$, $b$, $c$ opposite angles $A$, $B$, $C$:

$$\boxed{c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C}$$

Or equivalently for any side:
- $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos A$
- $b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac\cos B$

**When to use:** 
- SAS: Two sides and the included angle
- SSS: All three sides (to find angles)

**Note:** When $C = 90°$, this becomes Pythagoras! (since $\cos 90° = 0$)

---

**Find the missing side:**

**14.** $a = 7$, $b = 10$, $C = 50°$. Find $c$.

**15.** $b = 12$, $c = 8$, $A = 110°$. Find $a$.

- Earth is 1 AU from the Sun
- Mars is 1.5 AU from the Sun  
- The angle at the Sun between Earth and Mars is 60°

Find the distance from Earth to Mars at this moment.

**23.** Venus is 0.72 AU from the Sun. When Venus is at "greatest elongation" (maximum angular distance from the Sun as seen from Earth), the Earth-Venus-Sun angle is 90°.

Using the Law of Cosines with Earth at 1 AU and the Sun-Earth-Venus angle at greatest elongation:
- (a) If the Sun-Earth-Venus angle is 46°, find the Earth-Venus distance.

What is the direct distance from A to B that the spacecraft is avoiding?

**28.** A satellite in orbit has position vectors at two times:
- Time 1: 7000 km from Earth center, at angle 0°
- Time 2: 7500 km from Earth center, at angle 25° (angular separation)

## Part C: Area of Triangles (14 problems)

### Multiple Formulas

**Base and Height:**
$$A = \frac{1}{2}bh$$

**Two Sides and Included Angle:**
$$\boxed{A = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin C}$$

**Heron's Formula (three sides):**
